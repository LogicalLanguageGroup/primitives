# Conceptual Primitives

The purpose of this repository is to systematically identify and document conceptual primitives.

For example, the concept of "eat" or "ingest" or "consume" relates two things (the eater and the food). Saying something "is food" does not remove the role of the eater from the relationship, it just leaves it unspecified. It doesn't make sense to break down this relationship more. Also, this relationship does not need more concepts conflated with it (e.g. "eating" vs "ate").
