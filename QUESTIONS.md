### Justify this is Primitive

- Is it a primary/atomic concept? Is it tangled with some concept that should be orthogonal? Can you think of an example where the concept is orthogonal?

- Consider if key words in the definition were replaced with (near) synonyms, would it introduce some orthogonal meaning?

  > e.g. Lojban `citka`: Defined as `eat` vs `consume` vs `ingest`. Is it about bringing food into digestive system? Or about absorbing nutrition from it?

- Is it the opposite/negation or variation of intensity/strength of another Primitive Conceptual Predicate?

- What are the best attempts to construct this Conceptual Predicate with other Primitive Conceptual Predicates?

  > e.g. Lojban `linto` vs `cmalu grake`, `tilju` vs `barda grake`: The base gismu should be something like "x1 has mass". I think `grake` is the best fit. Weight is not mass so `junta` is wrong.

### Justification of roles included/excluded in the concept?

- Are all of the roles essential to the concept? Can any roles be separated to an orthogonal relationship?

  > e.g. Lojban: The "under conditions" places are examples of being orthogonal to the core concept of the gismu.

- What are examples of an entities which fill each role in the predicate?

  > e.g. Lojban: What do each of the places mean as a sumti? What are translations for: `lo broda`, `lo se broda`, `lo te broda`, `lo ve broda`.

- What plausibly important things were excluded? Is the core concept complete?

- Can you think of examples of two destinct aspects of the concept that both best fit in the same role? In other words, is any role overloaded?


### Define the Primitive Conceptual Predicate in detail

After justifying this word should exist, rather than the alternatives.
Now we need to explicitly explain how it differs from each alternative or similar word.
The definitions of these Conceptual Predicate should explain how these differ from each other.

- What are examples of when this Predicate does or does not apply?

- What distinguishes this Primitive Conceptual Predicate from similar/related Primitive Conceptual Predicates?

  > e.g. Lojban `fenki` vs `bebna`; can bebna x1 be an event?

  > e.g. Lojban `zgana` vs `catlu`; how do these differ? the distinction is not clear from in the definitions.

- Are there any Primitive Conceptual Predicate that have potentially similar places? How do they differ?

  > e.g. Lojban `lo fasnu` vs `lo se gasnu` vs `lo rinka` vs `lo se bredi`;
which of these is equivilent to "an event"? Why?

- Can you think of an example where swapping this Conceptual Predicate for the potentially similar Conceptual Predicate would cause the bridi to change from true to false.

### Check the definition is culturally neutral

- Does it refer to any culture specific icons or customs?
- How does the definition tie to current technology, which may change in the future? Is a flying car still a \jbo{karce}?
- Would it work for an alien culture?

  > e.g. Lojban `terdi`: is this Earth specifically? Would an alien race call their home planet `terdi`?
  > I would expect a definition like "x1 is a terrestrial planet" (with maybe some other places like "...in system x2...", etc.).
 Â > Earth would then be the human terrestrial planet, `remna terdi` or some lujvo of that.
  > This would be similar to the way lojban names countries, `sralo gugde` = Australia.
